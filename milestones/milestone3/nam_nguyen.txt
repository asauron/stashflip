For the electric-leaf.heroku.com roomate app, I really like how they used a colorful display for http://electric-leaf.heroku.com/chores. It uses jQuery, facebox, and AJAX to load "/chores/#{chore.id}" when you click on the chore. Once you click checkoff a checkmark appears in the table too if chore.is_done. You can also hide or show the completed chores. This is accomplished through a javascript function toggleCompletedChores() which hides contentRowDone, and this class for tr (either contentRowDone or contentRow) is set by going through @chores.each. The code is clear and produces pretty effects.
