I checked out rottenCucumber's homepage code.
I was shocked to see their new member or old member selection process.
It is really neat and clean compared to how my group's application is logging in and signing up users. I thought I really need to learn the javascript and implement these kinds of selection process to my application.
Also, rottenCucumber's group does not have many codes in each of the files. I don't need to scroll down as much as my application's code files to see what's going on. Seeing rottenCucumber's application design and implementation, I realize that I need to simplify things with javascript and refactor ruby codes.
