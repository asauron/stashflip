For the FoodRun website, I liked how the models were crisp and clean, and did only what they were conceptually meant to do, which is to keep track of its corresponding data. This made me think about refactoring the models for our Beatmap website, which is fairly bulky and complex. Also, I like how only parts of the view are loaded, while others are kept throughout (such as the right sidebar with top recipes, featured recipes, etc). All in all, a very clean and neat looking website with modular code.
